# Min Max Explaination

Min-max problem refers to finding the minimum and maximum element in an array of elements. One efficient way to solve this problem is using the divide and conquer algorithm.

The idea behind the divide and conquer algorithm is to divide the array into two halves, find the minimum and maximum elements in each half, and then compare the minimum and maximum of the two halves to get the final result.

The time complexity of the divide and conquer algorithm to find the minimum and maximum elements in an array is O(nlogn). The algorithm divides the array into two halves recursively logn times, and finding the minimum and maximum elements in each half takes O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity of the algorithm is O(nlogn).
